Easily add "basic" color styling to your sywac CLI:

```js
// cli.js
const cli = require('sywac')
const basicStyle = require('sywac-style-basic')
cli.style(basicStyle)
```

This will add style hooks to make your CLI help text colorful/pretty.

Note that this package DOES NOT wrap/include/come with sywac - you should have sywac as a sibling dependency.

Visit http://sywac.io/docs/sync-config.html#style for detailed documentation.

## Install

Install sywac and this package together, saving them as production dependencies in your package.json file:

```console
$ npm i -P sywac sywac-style-basic
```

See code snippet above for usage.
